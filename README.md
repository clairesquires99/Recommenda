# Recommenda

A cross-platform app for iOS, Android and web that allows users to recommend books, films, music, podcasts and articles to their friends.

> [!NOTE]  
> This app is currently a work in progress.

## Author's Note
This is the second version of the Recommenda app. The first version (see repo [here](https://github.com/clairesquires99/RecommendationApp)) was developed using Flask as mobile-first web app. See this repo for more detailed information about the functionality of the app.

This version will serve as a challenge to recreate the same app as a mobile app instead, using React Native, with the intention to ultimately launch it on the Apple Store and Google Play Store.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Running Locally Using Expo Go
1. Install Expo Go on your mobile device
2. Clone the repo and run the app
```
git clone
yarn
yarn start
// This should start running the app on Expo Go
```

3. Scan the QR code shown in your terminal in the Expo Go app. The app should load shortly.
4. Create a new user, and explore the app!
